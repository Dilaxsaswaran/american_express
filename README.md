Problem Statement
Whether out at a restaurant or buying tickets to a concert, modern life counts on the convenience of a credit card to make daily purchases. It saves us from carrying large amounts of cash and also can advance a full purchase that can be paid over time.

How do card issuers know we’ll pay back what we charge? That’s a complex problem with many existing solutions—and even more potential improvements, to be explored in this competition.

Credit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business.

Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics.
Current models exist to help manage risk. But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use.

The objective of this competition is to predict the probability that a customer does not pay back their credit card balance amount in the future based on their monthly customer profile.

The target binary variable is calculated by observing 18 months performance window after the latest credit card statement, and if the customer does not pay due amount in 120 days after their latest statement date it is considered a default event.
